This dataset contains a total of 5 folders:
1. NORMAL
2. PNEUMONIA
3. test
4. validation

We used NORMAL and PNEUMONIA to train our model and made the test, validation and train splits manually in our code. We did not use the given test, validation and train folders. 
NORMAL and PNEUMONIA folders contained a total of 5863 images of which there were 4273 pneumonic samples and 1583 normal samples.
